Changes
=======

Version 0.4.1 (released 2022-02-23)

- Removes upper bound on Click which causes projects where docker-services-cli
  is installed to limit Celery to v5.1.x because Celery v5.2 requires Click 8+.

Version 0.4.0 (released 2022-02-15)

- Changes default version of Postgres to v12.
- Adds Postgres v14 and upgrades other versions.

Version 0.3.1 (released 2021-08-04)

- Fixes an issue where created volumes were not removed again.
